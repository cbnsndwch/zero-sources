## PipelineTableMapping.pipeline property

Aggregation pipeline stages executed in order before projection.

Stages are processed sequentially: 1. Each stage transforms the document 2. Stages execute in array order 3. Projection applies last (if specified)

Common patterns: - Filter before unwinding for performance: `[{ $match: ... }, { $unwind: ... }]` - Filter unwound elements: `[{ $unwind: ... }, { $match: ... }]` - Add computed fields: `[{ $addFields: ... }]`

**Signature:**

```typescript
pipeline: PipelineStage<TTable>[];
```
