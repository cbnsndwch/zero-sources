### Plugin Architecture

```typescript
// Required Lexical plugins
import { AutoLinkPlugin } from '@lexical/react/LexicalAutoLinkPlugin';
import { LinkPlugin } from '@lexical/react/LexicalLinkPlugin';

// Custom plugins to implement
import { MentionsPlugin } from './plugins/MentionsPlugin';
import { HashtagPlugin } from './plugins/HashtagPlugin';
import { EmojiPlugin } from './plugins/EmojiPlugin';
import { LinkEditorPlugin } from './plugins/LinkEditorPlugin';
```

### Node Types

```typescript
// Custom node definitions
import { MentionNode } from './nodes/MentionNode';
import { HashtagNode } from './nodes/HashtagNode';
import { EmojiNode } from './nodes/EmojiNode';

}
```

### Link Processing

```typescript
const URL_MATCHERS = [
    (text: string) => {
        const match = URL_REGEX.exec(text);
        if (match) {
            return {
                index: match.index,
                length: match[0].length,
                text: match[0],
                url: normalizeUrl(match[0]),
                attributes: {
                    rel: 'noopener noreferrer',
                    target: '_blank'
                }
            };
        }
        return null;
    }
];
```

```

**Core Components Integration:**
```typescript
import { EmojiPicker } from 'frimousse';

// Frimousse implementation
interface FrimousseEmojiPickerProps {
    onEmojiSelect: ({ emoji }: { emoji: string }) => void;
    locale?: string;
    skinTone?: 'none' | 'light' | 'medium-light' | 'medium' | 'medium-dark' | 'dark';
    columns?: number;
    sticky?: boolean;
    emojiVersion?: number;

    categories: EmojiCategory[];
    searchEnabled?: boolean;
}

interface EmojiCategory {
    name: string;
    emojis: string[];
    icon: string;
}

// Frimousse-based implementation
const RichMessageEmojiPicker = ({ onEmojiSelect, className }: FrimousseEmojiPickerProps) => (
    <EmojiPicker.Root 
        onEmojiSelect={onEmojiSelect}
        className={className}
        columns={10}
        skinTone="none"
        sticky={true}
    >
        <EmojiPicker.Search />
        <EmojiPicker.Viewport>
            <EmojiPicker.Loading>Loading emojis...</EmojiPicker.Loading>
            <EmojiPicker.Empty>No emoji found.</EmojiPicker.Empty>
            <EmojiPicker.List />

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **User Data Integration**: Complex integration with user directory systems
    - _Mitigation_: Early integration testing and API validation
    - _Contingency_: Fallback to simple mention system

2. **Performance Impact**: Interactive features may slow down editor
    - _Mitigation_: Performance monitoring and optimization
    - _Contingency_: Progressive loading and feature toggles

### Medium Risk

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Link and user data handling security risks
    - _Mitigation_: Comprehensive security review and testing
    - _Contingency_: Conservative security defaults and restrictions

4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Different behavior across platforms/browsers
    - _Mitigation_: Extensive cross-platform testing
    - _Contingency_: Platform-specific implementations

### Low Risk

5. **User Experience Complexity**: Too many interactive features may confuse users
    - _Mitigation_: User testing and progressive disclosure
    - _Contingency_: Simplified default configuration
