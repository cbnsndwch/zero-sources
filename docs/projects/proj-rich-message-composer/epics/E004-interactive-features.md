## Technical Implementation

### Plugin Architecture
```typescript
// Required Lexical plugins
import { AutoLinkPlugin } from '@lexical/react/LexicalAutoLinkPlugin';
import { LinkPlugin } from '@lexical/react/LexicalLinkPlugin';

// Custom plugins to implement
import { MentionsPlugin } from './plugins/MentionsPlugin';
import { HashtagPlugin } from './plugins/HashtagPlugin';
import { EmojiPlugin } from './plugins/EmojiPlugin';
import { LinkEditorPlugin } from './plugins/LinkEditorPlugin';
```

### Node Types
```typescript
// Custom node definitions
import { MentionNode } from './nodes/MentionNode';
import { HashtagNode } from './nodes/HashtagNode';
import { EmojiNode } from './nodes/EmojiNode';
import { LinkNode } from '@lexical/link';

const editorConfig = {
  nodes: [
    LinkNode,
    MentionNode,
    HashtagNode,
    EmojiNode,
    // ... other nodes
  ]
};
```

### Mention System Implementation
```typescript
interface MentionData {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  displayName: string;
  avatar?: string;
}

interface MentionsPluginProps {
  users: MentionData[];
  onUserSearch: (query: string) => Promise<MentionData[]>;
  onMentionSelect: (user: MentionData) => void;
  maxResults?: number;
}
```

### Link Processing
```typescript
const URL_MATCHERS = [
  (text: string) => {
    const match = URL_REGEX.exec(text);
    if (match) {
      return {
        index: match.index,
        length: match[0].length,
        text: match[0],
        url: normalizeUrl(match[0]),
        attributes: {
          rel: 'noopener noreferrer',
          target: '_blank'
        }
      };
    }
    return null;
  }
];
```

### Emoji System
```typescript
interface EmojiPickerProps {
  onEmojiSelect: (emoji: string) => void;
  recentEmojis: string[];
  categories: EmojiCategory[];
  searchEnabled?: boolean;
}

interface EmojiCategory {
  name: string;
  emojis: string[];
  icon: string;
}
```

2. **Performance Impact**: Interactive features may slow down editor
   - *Mitigation*: Performance monitoring and optimization
   - *Contingency*: Progressive loading and feature toggles

### Medium Risk
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Link and user data handling security risks
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive security review and testing
   - *Contingency*: Conservative security defaults and restrictions

4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Different behavior across platforms/browsers
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive cross-platform testing
   - *Contingency*: Platform-specific implementations

### Low Risk
5. **User Experience Complexity**: Too many interactive features may confuse users
   - *Mitigation*: User testing and progressive disclosure
