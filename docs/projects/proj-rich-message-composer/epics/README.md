## Risk Management

### Cross-Epic Dependencies
1. **E001 → E002-E005**: Core integration must be stable before feature development
2. **E002 → E003-E005**: Component architecture affects all feature implementations
3. **E003-E005 → E006**: Features must be complete for comprehensive testing
4. **E001-E006 → E007**: Documentation requires implemented features
5. **E001-E007 → E008**: All components needed for production deployment

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Daily stand-ups** between dependent teams
- **Epic completion gates** with defined acceptance criteria
- **Integration testing** at each phase boundary
- **Feature flags** for gradual rollout and risk reduction
- **Rollback procedures** for each deployment phase
