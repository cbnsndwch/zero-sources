# Epic E002: Basic Component Architecture

**Epic ID**: E002  
**Epic Name**: Basic Component Architecture  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Estimated Effort**: 8 story points  
**Sprint Duration**: 1.5 weeks  
**Team**: Component Library Team  
**Dependencies**: E001 (Core Lexical Integration)

## Epic Summary

Design and implement the foundational component architecture for the rich message composer. This epic focuses on creating reusable, well-structured components that can be shared between ZRocket and Circle-Talk applications while maintaining clean separation of concerns and following established design patterns.

## Epic Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Component Design System**: Create consistent, reusable components following design system principles
2. **Application Integration**: Replace existing `ChatInput` components with new Lexical-powered versions
3. **State Management**: Implement proper state management for editor content and UI states
4. **Props Interface**: Design clean, intuitive props interface for consumer components
5. **Theme Integration**: Ensure components work with existing design systems

### Success Criteria

- ✅ New components successfully replace existing ChatInput in both applications
- ✅ Component props interface is intuitive and well-documented
- ✅ State management is predictable and performant
- ✅ Visual design matches existing application styling
- ✅ Components are fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Technical Implementation

└── package.json
```

### Core Interfaces

```typescript
interface RichMessageEditorProps {
    onSendMessage: (content: SerializedEditorState) => void;
    placeholder?: string;
    initialContent?: SerializedEditorState | string;
    disabled?: boolean;
    maxLength?: number;
    onDraftChange?: (content: SerializedEditorState | null) => void;
    theme?: EditorTheme;
    className?: string;
}

interface RichMessageDisplayProps {
    content: SerializedEditorState | string;
    className?: string;
    theme?: DisplayTheme;
    maxHeight?: number;
    showTimestamp?: boolean;
}
```

### State Management Patterns

```typescript
// Custom hook for editor state management
const useMessageEditor = (initialContent?: SerializedEditorState) => {
    const [editorState, setEditorState] =
        useState<SerializedEditorState | null>(null);
    const [isDirty, setIsDirty] = useState(false);
    const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);

    // State management logic

    return {
        editorState,
        isDirty,
        error,
        clearEditor,
        setError
        // Other methods
    };
};
```

## Design Requirements

### Visual Design

- **Consistency**: Match existing ChatInput visual design
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Rich features appear contextually
- **Focus States**: Clear visual focus indicators
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions during initialization

### Interaction Design

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Touch Targets**: Appropriate sizing for mobile devices
- **Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- **Error States**: Helpful error messages and recovery options

### Responsive Behavior

- **Mobile**: Optimized toolbar and interaction patterns
- **Tablet**: Balanced desktop/mobile experience
- **Desktop**: Full feature set with hover states

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Component rendering with various props
- State management hooks
- Utility functions
- Error boundary behavior

### Integration Tests

- Component integration with Lexical
- Theme and styling application
- Cross-application compatibility
- Accessibility compliance

### Visual Regression Tests

- Component appearance across themes
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Dark mode and high contrast
- Loading and error states

## Performance Requirements

### Component Performance

- **Initial Render**: <50ms
- **State Updates**: <16ms
- **Memory Usage**: <2MB per editor instance
- **Bundle Size**: <20KB for component library

### Optimization Strategies

- Lazy loading for complex features
- Memoization for expensive computations
- Virtual scrolling for large message lists
- Code splitting for optional features

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 ratio for text, 3:1 for interactive elements
- **Focus Management**: Logical focus order and visible focus indicators

### Testing Approach

- Automated accessibility testing (axe-core)
- Manual testing with screen readers
- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- High contrast mode verification

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Component API Design**: Poor API design affects all future development
    - _Mitigation_: Extensive API review and validation
    - _Contingency_: Versioned API with migration guides

2. **Performance Impact**: Components may slow down message rendering
    - _Mitigation_: Performance monitoring and optimization
    - _Contingency_: Lazy loading and virtualization

### Medium Risk

3. **Cross-Application Compatibility**: Different React versions or patterns
    - _Mitigation_: Thorough testing in both environments
    - _Contingency_: Application-specific adapters

4. **Theme Integration**: Styling conflicts with existing systems
    - _Mitigation_: CSS-in-JS isolation and theme testing
    - _Contingency_: Custom CSS variables and overrides

### Low Risk

5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Complex rich text may have a11y issues
    - _Mitigation_: Early accessibility testing and validation
    - _Contingency_: Progressive enhancement with fallbacks
