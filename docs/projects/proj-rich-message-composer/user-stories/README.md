## Cross-Epic Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **E001 â†’ All Others**: Core integration must be stable
2. **E002 â†’ E003, E004, E005**: Component architecture affects all features
3. **E003, E004 â†’ E006**: Features must be complete for testing
4. **E001-E005 â†’ E007**: Documentation requires implemented features
5. **E001-E007 â†’ E008**: All components needed for deployment

### Story-Level Dependencies
- E002-US01 depends on E001-US05 (Editor component needs basic editor)
- E003-US04 depends on E002-US01 (Toolbar needs editor component)
- E004-US06 depends on E002-US02 (Interactive display needs display component)
- E005-US01 depends on E003-US04 (Mobile toolbar needs desktop toolbar)
