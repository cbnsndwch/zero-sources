## [LEX][E01] Rich Text Features Implementation

**GitHub Issue**: #10
**Priority**: Critical
**Status**: Ready

### Epic Summary

Implement essential rich text features including formatting (bold, italic, etc.), automatic link detection, and list support to provide users with a modern messaging experience.

### User Value Proposition

**As a** User  
**I want** rich text formatting capabilities in my messages  
**So that** I can express myself more clearly and create more engaging content

### Success Metrics

- Text formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough) working correctly
- Automatic URL detection and linking functionality
- Ordered and unordered list support
- Keyboard shortcuts for all formatting options (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, etc.)
- Copy/paste of formatted content working properly
- All features output valid `SerializedEditorState` format

### Child Issues

- #35 - [LEX][E01_01] Implement AutoLink Plugin for URL Detection
- #36 - [LEX][E01_02] Add List Support (Ordered and Unordered)

### Dependencies

- Depends on: Foundation & Core Lexical Integration (Epic #9 - completed/closed)

### Risk Factors

- **Risk**: Performance impact from rich text parsing  
  **Mitigation**: Performance testing, lazy loading of plugins
- **Risk**: Browser compatibility issues  
  **Mitigation**: Comprehensive cross-browser testing

- Emoji integration with existing picker
- Draft persistence mechanism
- Mobile optimization

### Dependencies

- Depends on: #10 (Rich Text Features Implementation)
- Mentions feature depends on user directory API

### Risk Factors

- **Risk**: Toolbar positioning complexity  
  **Mitigation**: Use proven floating UI library
- **Risk**: Draft storage conflicts  
  **Mitigation**: Proper conflict resolution strategy

**As a** Product Owner  
**I want** thorough testing of the rich text editor  
**So that** we can confidently deploy without bugs or performance issues

### Success Metrics

- Unit test coverage >90% for all components
- Integration tests covering all user scenarios
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance benchmarks met (<100ms latency, <50KB bundle)
- Cross-browser compatibility verified (4+ browsers)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) validated

### Child Issues

- #27 - [LEX][E03_01] Unit Testing for RichMessageEditor Components
- #28 - [LEX][E03_02] Integration Testing with Chat Components
- #29 - [LEX][E03_03] Performance Testing and Optimization
- #30 - [LEX][E03_04] Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing
- #31 - [LEX][E03_05] Accessibility Compliance Testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- #32 - [LEX][E03_06] End-to-End Testing and Final Validation

### Testing Phase Dependencies

```
#27 (Unit) → #28 (Integration) → #29 (Performance)
                 ↓                    ↓
#30 (Cross-Browser) ← #31 (Accessibility)
                 ↓
            #32 (E2E Final)
```

### Quality Gates

- Unit Test Coverage: >90%
- Integration Test Coverage: 100% of user flows
- Performance: <100ms input latency (95th percentile)
- Bundle Size: <50KB increase gzipped
- Browser Compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge + mobile
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- E2E Coverage: All critical user journeys

### Dependencies

- Depends on: All implementation from Epics 1-2 completed
- Requires testing environment and test data

### Risk Factors

- **Risk**: Insufficient test coverage missing edge cases  
  **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test planning, code review
