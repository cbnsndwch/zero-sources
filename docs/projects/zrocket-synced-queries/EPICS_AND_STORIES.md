### [ZSQ][E01_01] Configure Zero-Cache Query Endpoint

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

#### User Story

**As a** DevOps Engineer  
**I want** Zero-cache configured to forward query requests to our API  
**So that** clients can use synced queries with server-side filtering

#### Background/Context

Zero-cache needs to know where to send get-queries requests. This involves setting environment variables and verifying the routing works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** Zero-cache is running  
**When** I set `ZERO_GET_QUERIES_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/zero/get-queries"`  
**Then** Zero-cache should forward query requests to our NestJS API

**And** the connection should be verified in zero-cache logs  
**And** health check endpoints should confirm connectivity

#### Technical Details

- **Files to modify**: 
  - `apps/source-mongodb-server/.env`
  - `apps/zrocket/.env` (for documentation)
- **Environment variables**: `ZERO_GET_QUERIES_URL`
- **Verification**: Test with curl or Postman to confirm routing

#### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Manual testing of endpoint reachability
- [ ] Verify zero-cache logs show successful routing
- [ ] Test with invalid URL to verify error handling
- [ ] Document connection troubleshooting steps

**Estimated Effort**: 0.5 days

#### User Story

**As a** Backend Developer  
**I want** TypeScript types for query context  
**So that** I have type safety when working with authenticated user information

#### Background/Context

Query context contains user authentication data extracted from JWT tokens. We need strongly-typed definitions to ensure type safety across client and server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I'm writing a synced query function  
**When** I access the context parameter  
**Then** TypeScript should provide autocomplete and type checking for user properties

**And** the context should include userID, role, and username  
**And** a type guard function should verify authentication status

#### Technical Details

- **Status**: Type definition updated to match actual JWT claims. See [QUERYCONTEXT_FIX.md](./QUERYCONTEXT_FIX.md)
- **Exports implemented**:
  ```typescript
  export type QueryContext = {
    userID: string;              // from JWT 'sub'
    email: string;               // from JWT 'email'
    name?: string;               // from JWT 'name'
    preferredUsername?: string;  // from JWT 'preferred_username'
    picture?: string;            // from JWT 'picture'
    roles?: string[];            // from JWT 'roles'
  };

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day

#### User Story

**As a** Frontend Developer  
**I want** updated React hooks using synced queries for messages  
**So that** message components display only accessible messages

#### Background/Context

Messages need room type information to apply correct permissions. The hook interface should remain simple for component consumers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I'm using the useRoomMessages hook with a channel ID  
**When** the component renders  
**Then** it should return messages for that public channel

**Given** I'm using the useRoomMessages hook with a private room ID  
**When** I'm not a member  
**Then** it should return an empty array without errors

#### User Story

**As a** Frontend Developer  
**I want** all components migrated to use hooks instead of direct queries  
**So that** the entire application benefits from synced query permissions

#### Background/Context

Some components may directly use Zero queries instead of hooks. These need to be migrated to use the updated hooks for consistency and permission enforcement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** a component directly uses `zero.query.channels`  
**When** I refactor it to use `useChannels()` hook  
**Then** the component should function identically

**And** no direct query usage should remain in components  
**And** all components should use the hooks layer  
**And** UI behavior should be unchanged from user perspective

#### Technical Details

### [ZSQ][E03_01] Create Room Access Service

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days

#### User Story

**As a** Backend Developer  
**I want** a service to check room membership  
**So that** I can efficiently determine if a user has access to a room

#### Background/Context

Permission filtering requires checking if a user is a member of a room. This logic should be centralized, optimized, and reusable across all query filters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I call `userHasRoomAccess` with a userID and channelID  
**When** the room is a public channel  
**Then** it should return true without database queries

**Given** I call `userHasRoomAccess` with a userID and chatID  
**When** the user is a member of that chat  
**Then** it should return true

**And** when the user is not a member, it should return false  
**And** the database query should be efficient (use indexes)

**Given** I call `getUserAccessibleRoomIds` with a userID  
**When** the user is a member of multiple rooms  
**Then** it should return all accessible room IDs efficiently

#### Technical Details

- **Files to create**: `apps/zrocket/src/features/zero-queries/room-access.service.ts`
- **Methods required**:
  - `userHasRoomAccess(userId: string, roomId: string, roomType: 'channel' | 'chat' | 'group'): Promise<boolean>`
