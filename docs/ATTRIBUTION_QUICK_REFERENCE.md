# Attribution Quick Reference

A quick guide for contributors on how to properly attribute external code and inspirations.

---

## Decision Tree: Do I Need to Attribute?

```
Did you write 100% original code with no external inspiration?
├─ YES → No attribution needed (just sign CLA)
└─ NO → Continue...

Did you copy/adapt code from another source?
├─ YES → ⚠️ REQUIRED: Inline comment + check license + update ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md
└─ NO → Continue...

Were you inspired by another project's design/architecture?
├─ YES → ⚠️ REQUIRED: Add to ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md, consider inline comment
└─ NO → Continue...

Did you learn a technique from documentation/tutorial?
├─ YES → ℹ️ OPTIONAL: Mention in ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md (best practice)
└─ NO → You're good!
```

## Quick Templates

### 1. Direct Code Adaptation (REQUIRED)

```typescript
/**
 * Adapted from: [Project Name] (https://github.com/user/repo)
 * Original License: MIT
 * Changes: Brief description of modifications
 */
export function myFunction() {
  // Your code
}
```

### 2. Design Inspiration (RECOMMENDED)

```typescript
/**
 * Implementation inspired by [Project]'s approach to [feature]
 * See: https://github.com/user/repo/path/to/file
 */
export class MyClass {
  // Your implementation
}
```

### 3. Algorithm Reference (OPTIONAL BUT NICE)

```typescript
// Algorithm based on: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/123456
function efficientSort() {
  // Your implementation
}
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Found code on Stack Overflow

**Action**:
```typescript
// Solution adapted from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/123456/username
// License: CC BY-SA 4.0 (Stack Overflow default)
```

**Note**: Stack Overflow code is CC BY-SA, which requires attribution. Small snippets usually OK under fair use.

---

### Scenario: Learned pattern from another Zero project

**Action**:
```typescript
/**
 * Change source pattern inspired by @rocicorp/zero documentation
 * See: https://zero.rocicorp.dev/docs/change-sources
 */
```

**Plus**: Add to ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md if it's a significant pattern.

---

### Scenario: Using official library examples

**Action**: Usually no attribution needed (examples meant to be copied), but nice to add:
```typescript
// Based on example from: https://docs.example.com/guide
```

---

### Scenario: Rocket.Chat-style architecture (like zrocket)

**Action**:
- ✅ Add to ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md under "Inspirational Sources"
- ✅ Mention in PR description
- ✅ Add comment in key files:
```typescript
/**
 * Entity schema inspired by Rocket.Chat's domain model
 * This is an independent implementation adapted for Zero
 */
```

---

## Red Flags 🚩

Stop and ask for guidance if:

- ❌ Source code has no license
- ❌ License says "no commercial use"
- ❌ License says "no derivatives"
- ❌ You're not sure who owns the code
- ❌ Code is from your employer's private repo
- ❌ License is GPL/AGPL/LGPL
- ❌ You copied more than a few lines without permission

It shows respect for others' work and protects everyone involved.
