# Conversation Context: Zero Table Mapping Strategy Update

## User Request
The strategy of stuffing JSON data into the zero table's `.from(...)` helper is outdated. We now have a completely out-of-band table mapping strategy (look at how zrocket handles them). 

Both your instructions file and the `docs\zero-virtual-tables\example-chat-discriminated-unions.md` file need to be updated to reflect this.

## Current State Analysis

I analyzed the current codebase and found that the documentation in `docs\zero-virtual-tables\example-chat-discriminated-unions.md` still shows the outdated approach of using `.from()` helper with JSON configuration, while the actual implementation in zrocket uses a separate out-of-band table mapping strategy.

## Key Findings

### Current Documentation Shows (Outdated):
```typescript
// OLD APPROACH - Using .from() with JSON config
const chats = table('chats')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    participantIds: json<string[]>(),
    createdAt: string(),
    lastMessageAt: string()
  })
  .primaryKey('id')
  .from({
    source: 'rooms',
    filter: { t: { $eq: 'd' }, isArchived: { $ne: true } },
    projection: { _id: 1, participantIds: 1, createdAt: 1, lastMessageAt: 1 }
  });
```

### Current zrocket Implementation Uses (Modern):
```typescript
// NEW APPROACH - Separate table mapping configuration
const chats = table('chats')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    participantIds: json<string[]>(),
    createdAt: string(),
    lastMessageAt: string()
  })
  .primaryKey('id');

const chatsMapping: TableMapping<IDirectMessageRoom> = {
  source: 'rooms',
  filter: { t: { $eq: 'd' }, isArchived: { $ne: true } },
  projection: { _id: 1, participantIds: 1, createdAt: 1, lastMessageAt: 1 }
};

// Export table mappings for use by change source
export const mapping = {
  chats: chatsMapping,
  groups: groupsMapping,
  channels: channelsMapping,
  userMessages: userMessagesMapping,
  systemMessages: systemMessagesMapping
};
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Documentation Structure
- Removed all references to `.from()` helper method
- Added clear separation between Zero table definitions and mapping configurations
- Updated examples to show the modern out-of-band approach
- Added explanation of how change sources use these separate mapping configurations

### 2. Key Benefits of New Approach
- **Clean separation of concerns**: Zero schema definitions are separate from data source mapping
- **Reusable mappings**: Table mappings can be used by multiple change sources
- **Type safety**: Mapping configurations are typed with TypeScript interfaces
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify mappings without touching schema definitions
- **Flexibility**: Change sources can process mappings dynamically

### 3. Updated Change Stream Processing
The documentation now shows how change sources process documents using the separate mapping configurations:

1. **Access mapping configurations**: Retrieve the `TableMapping` objects for each Zero table
2. **Match source collections**: For a change in `rooms` collection, find all tables with `source: "rooms"`
3. **Apply filters**: Check if the changed document matches each table's filter criteria
4. **Apply projections**: For matching tables, apply the projection to extract only relevant fields
5. **Route to Zero tables**: Send the projected data to the appropriate Zero table(s)

## Files Updated
- `docs\zero-virtual-tables\example-chat-discriminated-unions.md` - Complete rewrite to reflect modern approach

## Next Steps
The user mentioned that "instructions file" also needs to be updated, but I need clarification on which specific instructions file they're referring to, as I didn't find a clear instructions file in the current workspace structure that contains the outdated `.from()` approach.

## Technical Notes
The new approach enables:
- Dynamic table mapping configuration
- Better separation between Zero client schema and backend data source configuration  
- More flexible change source implementations
- Easier testing and maintenance of mapping logic
- Type-safe mapping configurations with TypeScript interfaces

This conversation context can be used to continue the work of updating any remaining documentation or instruction files that still reference the outdated `.from()` helper approach.
