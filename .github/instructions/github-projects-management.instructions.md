### Labeling Taxonomy

#### Priority Labels
- `priority:critical` - Security issues, major bugs blocking releases
- `priority:high` - Important features, significant bugs
- `priority:medium` - Standard development work
- `priority:low` - Nice-to-have features, minor improvements

#### Type Labels
- `type:epic` - High-level features spanning multiple issues
- `type:feature` - New functionality
- `type:bug` - Defects and issues
- `type:enhancement` - Improvements to existing features
- `type:documentation` - Documentation updates
- `type:refactor` - Code refactoring without feature changes
- `type:technical-debt` - Technical debt reduction

#### Component Labels
- `component:frontend` - Frontend/UI related work
- `component:backend` - Backend/API related work
- `component:database` - Database changes
- `component:infrastructure` - DevOps, deployment, infrastructure
- `component:testing` - Testing framework and test creation

#### Status Labels
- `status:blocked` - Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- `status:in-progress` - Currently being worked on
- `status:review-needed` - Ready for code review
- `status:testing` - In testing phase
- `status:deployment` - Ready for or in deployment

### Milestone Strategy

#### Release Milestones
- **Naming Convention**: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}` or `Sprint {number}`
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks for sprints, 6-12 weeks for major releases
- **Scope**: 70-80% capacity to allow for unexpected work
- **Completion Criteria**: All must-have issues closed, nice-to-have moved to next milestone

#### Planning Milestones
- **Pre-Development**: Requirements gathering, design, architecture
- **Development Phases**: Implementation milestones for large projects
- **Testing & Integration**: QA, integration testing, bug fixes
- **Release Preparation**: Documentation, deployment preparation

### Project Board Configuration

#### Standard Board Columns
1. **Backlog** - Planned but not yet started
2. **Ready** - Ready to be picked up by developers
3. **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
4. **Review** - Code complete, awaiting review
5. **Testing** - In QA or testing phase
6. **Done** - Completed and merged

#### Advanced Board Views
- **By Priority**: Filter high-priority items across all columns
- **By Component**: Separate views for frontend, backend, etc.
- **By Assignee**: Personal dashboards for team members
- **By Milestone**: Release-focused views

## Automation & Workflow Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
- **Issue Templates**: Create templates for consistent issue creation
- **Auto-Labeling**: Automatic label application based on file changes
- **Milestone Automation**: Auto-assign issues to current milestone
- **Project Board Sync**: Keep project boards in sync with issue states

### Communication Protocols
- **Daily Updates**: Comment on issues with progress updates
- **Blocker Escalation**: Immediately flag and escalate blockers
- **Completion Notifications**: Tag relevant stakeholders when work completes
- **Review Requests**: Proactively request reviews when ready

## Best Practices

### Project Planning
1. **Start with User Stories**: Always begin with user-focused requirements
2. **Size Appropriately**: Keep individual tasks to 1-3 days of work
3. **Plan for Uncertainty**: Include buffer time for unexpected complexity
4. **Maintain Flexibility**: Be prepared to adjust scope and priorities

### Communication
1. **Overcommunicate Progress**: Regular updates prevent misalignment
2. **Document Decisions**: Capture architectural and design decisions in issues
3. **Link Related Work**: Use GitHub's linking features to connect related issues
4. **Provide Context**: Include sufficient background in all communications

### Quality Assurance
1. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Every issue must have testable completion criteria
2. **Definition of Done**: Establish and maintain consistent quality standards
3. **Review Requirements**: Ensure all work goes through appropriate review
4. **Testing Standards**: Maintain comprehensive testing at all levels

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Common Issues
- **Scope Creep**: Monitor and manage changing requirements
- **Dependency Delays**: Have contingency plans for blocked work
- **Resource Constraints**: Adjust scope based on available capacity
- **Technical Blockers**: Escalate and seek help for technical obstacles

### Recovery Strategies
- **Rapid Re-planning**: Quickly adjust plans when issues arise
- **Alternative Approaches**: Have backup solutions for technical challenges
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Keep all parties informed of changes
- **Lessons Learned**: Document and learn from project challenges
