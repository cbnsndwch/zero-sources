next we will {{ project_goals_and_description}}

read through the documentation in {{ general_documentation_entrypoint }} and the files it links to and come up with an action plan. No coding just yet, this is gonna be a plan-in-right-then-build-it-once type of project.

You must structure the project with a PRD and break it down into epics and user stories, so that a team of engineers and coding assistants can tackle it in parallel efficiently. Put all documentation in the `.local/product/proj-{{ project_identifier }}` directory

your success will be evaluated by how complete and clear your project planning and documentation are, and how well team members are able to understand it, leading to smooth and correct project execution
